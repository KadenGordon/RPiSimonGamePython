# Simon Game on Raspberry Pi with Python!
So to make this work you need this command (I believe) ```$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-rpi.gpio```
If that doesn't work create an issue.
I will also eventually be adding differnt class files and files that explain how to wire your raspberry pi. But that'll come later.
